Board State: (-1, -1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 0, 1)

Model Predictions:
move_prediction_0: 0
move_prediction_1: 0
move_prediction_2: 0
move_prediction_3: 0
move_prediction_4: 0
move_prediction_5: 0
move_prediction_6: 0
move_prediction_7: 1
move_prediction_8: 0
Evaluation: The model suggests placing the next move at index 7, which could potentially lead to a winning position for the AI.
