Dynamic Activation Mapping: While your method of defining activation functions is sound, ensure that all potential activation functions used in your models are included or handle exceptions where an unsupported activation is found.

Error Handling: There should be better error handling throughout, particularly where assumptions are made about the model structure or the presence of specific layers and parameters.
Code Organization and Reusability: Parts of the code could be refactored into smaller, more reusable functions, improving maintainability and readability.
